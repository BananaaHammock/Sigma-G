Listening to some chill stuff on Youtube with 'Sigma' while drinking coffee is the best ~

What's an userstyle ?
-------------------------------

Simply put, it's a script with a bunch of pseudo-code that will change the aspect of any website, it's kind like make-up I guess : you'll be able to change/modify the visual of the elements of the page (background, icon, buttons, etc...) and even delete some useless stuff. To use it, there is an add-on called 'Stylish' for the majority of the browser, so if you are on Chrome, Firefox, Opera and such go for it ! I also recommend you to go to userstyles.org (userstyles.org/) where you can found a lot of styles for a lot of website.

What do 'Sigma' change ? 
-------------------------------

I missed the good old layout of youtube, that's why I wanted to keep it as close as the original, but with a more modern look :
- in general, the 'biggest' change is of course the headbar which is now a sidebar because I love sidebar and haven't had a chance to write one for an website. Thus I replaced the differents buttons 'Upload', 'Sign out/Log in', 'Search', etc, by differents icons : for example, the user icon/log in button are represented by Ed (if you don't know Ed, just watch Cowboy Bebop, good stuff), and you'll be able to change the picture, to activate the search bar you'll have to hover the search icon, the upload button is the arrow and the notifications the clock, but I'm sure you were aware of it. I tweaked the appearance of the menubar a bit too and won't scroll with the page (you'll be able to scroll with the mouse when you click the menubar) : added a little banner (FLCL for the win) which is actually the home button, changed the font of the section and colors of the counter badge, removed the icons of the subsection (mychannel, trending, subscriptions, liked videos, ...), remplaced the old hover ffect by a simplier one.
- for the watch section you can go to the preview I posted before, if you are too lazy just stay here : in theater mode the video is much more bigger (in 720p), contrary to 'Spectre' I didn't really change the position of the elements (such as the action panel, the autoplay button, the uploader's avatar, etc.), and other than that, I put the title of each box (information, description and comment) in a box with some flat icon. Like usual, some colors, font-weight, colors were changed and others stuff (minor stuff don't worry) were removed, but I'm sure you'll realize all of it when you'll use this script.
- for the search, only thing you'll notice is (fucking again) a kind of banner at the top (same case for the history section even tho it isn't presented in the screenshot), for those who have a big screen and/or resolution, I made the result box a lot bigger (cause it was too small for my taste), for the filter you'll only just have to click the button and it will expand the box and the background with it. And of course (even tho you can't see it in the screenshot), the pagination box was changed too !
- for the others sections, you'll see it for yourself ~

How to install it ?
-------------------------------
After installing 'Stylish', you'll have to 'write a new style', copy/paste the code in 'sigma (desktop).css' or 'sigma (laptop).css', name the style and then save ! Before installing it, I suggest you :

* to install the font I used, namely 'Roboto' (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto), 'Bebas Neue' (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue), 'Bokutachi no Gothic 2' (http://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-gothic-2-bold/) and if you want Meiryo, all of them are free so don't be shy.
* download Adblock Plus to kill the ads.

Where can I find your works ?
